20140813 - Cinco Release 0.4

- possible source and target nodes of edges is now defined at the node's end
  with keywords incomingEdges and outgoingEdges, allowing cardinalities (the
  keywords sourceNode and targetNode have been removed) 
- basic copy&paste features are now generated (not yet preserving some minor
  graphical properties, such as edge bend points and decorator locations)
- added possibility to define appearances "inline" 
- appearances can now be defined for edgeStyle and edge decorators
- adapted annotation syntax to be more like Java: @annotationName(param1, param2, ...)
- renamed @Style annotation to @style
- "decorators {}"-syntax for edges changed to multiple "decorator {}"-blocks
- the .style editor now validates the parameters of the @style annotation
- new @multiLine annotation for attributes
- added predefined edge decorator shapes (ARROW, CIRCLE, DIAMOND, TRIANGLE)
- define CustomFeatures on nodes and containers with @customFeature annotation
- other node types can now be used as attributes
- error/success dialog after "Generate Cinco Product"
- again, many other small features and fixes


20140416 - Cinco Release 0.3

- containers can now contain other containers (thus containableNodes is renamed
  to containableElements)
- containableElements keyword can also be used for the root model
- Selecting edge decorators now shows the correct property view and highlights
  the corresponding edge
â€“ Several methods are generated into the model code, creating a more
  domain-specific API (e.g. typed getters for successors, predecessors, contained
  elements, ...)
- Many other small features and fixes
