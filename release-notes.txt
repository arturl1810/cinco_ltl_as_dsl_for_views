20140416 - Cinco Release 0.3

- containers can now contain other containers (thus containableNodes is renamed
  to containableElements)
- containableElements keyword can also be used for the root model
- Selecting edge decorators now shows the correct property view and highlights
  the corresponding edge
â€“ Several methods are generated into the model code, creating a more
  domain-specific API (e.g. typed getters for successors, predecessors, contained
  elements, ...)
- Many other small features and fixes
